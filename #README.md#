The initial chid config file will be like:

```YAML
---
:chid:
  :chid_path: "[CHID_FOLDER_PROJECT_PATH]"
  :workstations: {}
```

#### Base configuration

To add a new *workstation* you can edit like:

```YAML
---
:chid:
  :chid_path: "[CHID_FOLDER_PROJECT_PATH]"
  :workstations:
    :base: # Workstation Name
    - iTerm #Application Name
    - Safari
    - Slack
```

After edit you can open the **base** workstation running:

* `$ chid workstation:open['base']` - As rake task
* `work open base` - With the **chid** app running
